# Data Cleaning Project

### Project overview
This project focuses on cleaning and standardizing a raw cafÃ© sales dataset to ensure accuracy and consistency for analysis. The cleaned dataset provides a reliable foundation for business insights and decision-making.

Key tasks included handling missing values, correcting erroneous data in item names, prices, and quantities, and standardizing data types. Logical recalculations were applied to rectify inconsistencies in financial columns.

The dataset contained **missing, incorrect, and inconsistent values** in multiple columns, including 'Item,' 'Quantity,' 'Total Spent,' 'Payment Method,' 'Location,' and 'Transaction Date.' <br>
