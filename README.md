# Data Cleaning Project

### Project overview
This project focuses on cleaning and standardizing a raw caf√© sales dataset to ensure accuracy and consistency for analysis. The cleaned dataset provides a reliable foundation for business insights and decision-making.

Key tasks included handling missing values, correcting erroneous data in item names, prices, and quantities, and standardizing data types. Logical recalculations were applied to rectify inconsistencies in financial columns.

### **Data Preprocessing: Fixing Missing Item Details with Price and Quantity Logic**
The code cross-references item names and prices to reconcile missing or incorrect values. It checks if an item's price per unit matches a known price in a dictionary and fills in the correct name. If the price per unit is missing, it calculates it using 'Total Spent' and 'Quantity.' When prices are ambiguous (like $3 or $4) or both 'Total Spent' and 'Quantity' contain errors, the row is removed to maintain data accuracy.
